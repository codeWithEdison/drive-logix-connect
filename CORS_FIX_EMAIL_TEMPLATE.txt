Subject: URGENT: CORS Configuration Required for Mobile App API Access

Hi Backend Team,

We need to fix a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issue that's blocking all API requests from our mobile app.

PROBLEM:
The mobile app (Android/iOS) cannot make API requests to https://api.lovewaylogistics.com because the backend is not allowing requests from the mobile app's origin.

ERROR:
"Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://api.lovewaylogistics.com/v1/...' from origin 'https://localhost' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."

REQUIRED FIX:
Please configure the backend to allow CORS requests from these origins:

MOBILE APPS (Development & Production):
1. https://localhost (Android - works for both dev and Play Store apps)
2. capacitor://localhost (iOS - works for both dev and App Store apps)

WEB APPLICATIONS:
3. http://localhost:5173 (Web development)
4. https://your-production-domain.com (Production web - replace with your domain)

IMPORTANT: Apps installed from App Store and Play Store use the SAME origins as development apps.
No separate configuration needed for production mobile apps.

REQUIRED HEADERS:
The backend should respond with these headers for all API requests:

IMPORTANT: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` must be ONE value (NOT comma-separated).
Correct behavior: echo back the request Origin if it’s in the allowlist, and return `Vary: Origin`.

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://localhost   (example; should match incoming Origin)
Vary: Origin
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, Accept, Accept-Language
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

IMPORTANT:
- The backend must properly handle OPTIONS requests (preflight) for all endpoints
- All /v1/* endpoints are affected
- This is blocking all mobile app functionality

PRIORITY: HIGH - This is blocking all API communication from mobile app

I've attached a detailed technical document (BACKEND_CORS_FIX_REQUEST.md) with implementation examples for Express.js, Django, Laravel, and Nginx.

Please let me know once this is implemented so we can test.

Thanks!
